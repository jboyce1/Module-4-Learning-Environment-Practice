      <h2>Understanding Our Learning Environment</h2>
      <p>
        In our social studies class, maintaining social norms within our learning environment was a dynamic process. We regularly engaged in activities that encouraged reflection on social dynamics and norms. By using student-produced surveys, social network diagrams based on correlation coefficients, scenario experiments, implicit bias games, and social theory discussions, we delved into understanding the intricacies of our environment. These tools empowered students to explore and analyze the social fabric around them.

      <h2>Empowering Students Through Learning Activities</h2>
      <p>
        Through student-produced surveys, we gathered insights into individual perspectives and group dynamics, allowing for a nuanced understanding of our social environment. The social network diagrams aided in visualizing connections and correlations, fostering discussions on how relationships and interactions shape our experiences. Scenario experiments challenged preconceptions, while implicit bias games heightened awareness of unconscious attitudes.

      <h2>Promoting Social Awareness</h2>
      <p>
        Our exploration of social theories provided a framework to critically assess societal structures and norms. Students actively engaged in dissecting historical and contemporary contexts, fostering empathy and understanding diverse viewpoints. These opportunities for student empowerment created a platform for open dialogue, enhancing our grasp of societal norms and their impact on our learning environment.
